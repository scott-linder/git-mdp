# Git

[Git][1] is a distributed version control system.

It helps you manage arbitrary versions of files under a given directory.

# Version control

A "version" is probably more aptly called a "revision", because it is *not*
like the release schemes used by software packages (although git can help you
organize those as well).

You can track all sorts of things, all without any complicated server setup or
network connection.
